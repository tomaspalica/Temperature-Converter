# Temperature-Converter

This is a Temperature converter that converts one of 3 units of temperature, Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin.
Whenever you change value of one of the temperature units and enter or unfocus, other two will convert.
Whole code that converts values is made by using method switch that checks by inputs' name, wich inputs' value was changed.
I have added a button in the right top corner that lets you switch between light-moded and dark-mode.
I added this feature because i finished the converter to fast and wanted to add something more to the project.
